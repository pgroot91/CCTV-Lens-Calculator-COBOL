# CCTV Lens Calculator written in COBOL
Some people have ["Hello World"](https://github.com/search?q=hello+world)! But i have the [CCTV Lens Calculator](https://github.com/search?q=cctv+lens+calculator) :smile:

Please note this is written as an experiment me getting introduced to COBOL. 
Probably there are way more efficient ways to write/make this calculator in COBOL. 
You're free to create a PR with improvements.
